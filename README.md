# FuzeCSMatch
FUZECSMatch is a project created for testing by the company Fuze.

No external libraries were used; I chose to follow an 'mvvm' pattern with Swift-UI.
Since I've been working with Swift for Backend (Vapor) for a few months, I might have gotten confused regarding the UI, but I believe it can be overcome on a daily basis with other developers.

The API key needs to be replaced in the Constants file.
